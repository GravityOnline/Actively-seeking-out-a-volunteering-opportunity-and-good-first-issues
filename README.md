- ⚡ Fun fact: The first system i learned other than Windows was Mac Os and i used to play with Photoshop and Illustrator as a kid because my mom had a design studio. I particularly enjoyed playing with Bryce.
      I used to have a myspace page when it was still popular and i was webmaster from 2008 to 2019 of a website with over 2000 users so i had to do a lot of moderation and also now and then check the code.
