## Welcome to My GitHub Page! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm **@GravityOnline**, and I'm excited to connect and collaborate with the GitHub community. Here's a bit about me:

### About Me
- **Languages I Speak**: French, Spanish, Italian, English, and German.
- 
- **Background**: I completed my **Bachelor's in Gerontology** at Vechta University in Germany. Gerontology is an interdisciplinary field focused on the study of aging. During my studies, I covered a wide range of topics, including:
    - Sociology, Psychology, Politics, and Economics
    - Healthcare, Medicine, and Neuroscience
    - Education Science, Social Law, and Empirical Social Methods (using SPSS)
    - I even attended courses on **ArcGIS** and **R** (for statistical analysis) through the Faculty of Geography.

### Currently Learning ðŸŒ±
I am currently focusing on:
- **R**: Enhancing my skills in statistical analysis and data science.
- **Lua**: Exploring game development and scripting with Lua.
- **Python**: Deepening my knowledge in programming and automation.
- **HTML**: Improving my web development skills and creating accessible websites.
- **Git** and **GitHub**: Continuing to learn how to effectively collaborate and manage projects using version control.

### Collaboration & Projects ðŸ’ž
I'm particularly interested in collaborating on projects involving:
- **R**: Data science and statistical analysis.
- **Lua**: Game development and scripting.
- **HTML**: Web development and creating functional websites.

If you have any beginner-friendly project suggestions or ideas, feel free to reach out! I'd love to collaborate or discuss ideas.

### Fun Facts âš¡
- The first operating system I learned (other than Windows) was **Mac OS**. I used to experiment with **Photoshop** and **Illustrator** because my mom had a design studio. I particularly enjoyed creating in **Bryce**.
- I had a **MySpace** page back in the day, and from 2008 to 2019, I was the **webmaster** for a website with over 2,000 users. This experience gave me a lot of insight into **moderation** and occasional **code checks**.
