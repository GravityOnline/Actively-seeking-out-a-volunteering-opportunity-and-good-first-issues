# Welcome to my GitHub Page ! !

- 👋 Hi, i’m @GravityOnline but call me William or Gravity. I speak french, spanish, italian, english and german.
- 👀 I’m interested in doing some networking here and completed my bachelor in Gerontology in a small university in Vechta in Germany. Gerontology is an interdisciplinary science that researches ageing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontology . In my degree, to cite a few subjects, i studied sociology, psychology, politics, economy, health care/medicine/neuroscience, education science, social law, empirical social methods with SPSS and i even attended an ArcGis and R course offered by the faculty of geography. 
- 🌱 I’m just finished learning GitHub and Git on a book, i am revisiting the R language, learning Lua for its semplicity and speed, learning Python, revisiting HTML (i used to have a website, a myspace page and i read in 2024 2-3 chapters about HTML) and revisiting Excel
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on R and HTML and maybe Lua and Python later so if you have any suggestions on projects for beginners send me an e-mail..

- ⚡ Fun fact: The first system i learned other than Windows was Mac Os and i used to play with Photoshop and Illustrator as a kid because my mom had a design studio. I particularly enjoyed playing with Bryce.
      I used to have a myspace page when it was still popular and i was webmaster from 2008 to 2019 of a website with over 2000 users so i had to do a lot of moderation and also now and then check the code.
